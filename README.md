# SQL for Data Analysis

This repository contains the queries designed for the [SQL for Data Analysis](https://www.udacity.com/course/sql-for-data-analysis--ud198) on the Udacity Platform. 
The course focused on:
- Learning to execute core SQL commands to define, select, manipulate, control access to, aggregate, and join data and tables.
- It also provided material to understand when and how to use subqueries, several window functions, and partitions to complete complex tasks.
- Clean data, optimise SQL queries and write advanced JOINs to enhance analysis performance. 

**Notes**
- Most of the queries are executed using the Parch & Posey database (toy datasets).
- The course comprised eight lessons and was completed in 2023. The database schema and the EDR are shown below:
